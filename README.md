**Logo & Icon**

_The minimalist nature of Savvybooks overall brand and logo was inspired by the simplicity of old versions of Excel. The design includes grids, which we will talk more about below. As a rule, when presenting the logo within a grid, it is always right-aligned, inside of what looks like several rows and columns 'merged' into one, with breathing space. The logotype is written in slightly customised Ladna Regular with registered trademark symbol for finishing touch._

_The monogram itself can be used as a stand-alone element on mediums such as social media avatars. However, when using it separately, the name of the company/brand/product must be present in the same environment, such as social media profile names. When the logos are used outside the grid, then there has to be safe area around it. The safe area of the logo is defined by the width of the letter "S" from the wordmark - nothing can come closer to the logo than the area highlighted by the red outline. There can be more space around the logo but not less._

**Font**

_Ladna by Andree Paat sits in the "workhorse" category of typefaces that can just as easily be used for headlines and running text. As the customised registered trademark symbol and alternative letters are coded into the typeface, the logotype is "writable" without having to have file for the logo - but we do still provide the font in this repo._

**Grids**

_The excel inspired modular grid is one of our main visual elements and becomes the starting point for all layouts. Grids provide a framework for organizing content in a way that is visually appealing and easy to follow. By dividing a design into a grid of evenly spaced columns and rows, designers can create a sense of order and structure that helps guide the viewer's eye and makes the design easier to understand. Grids also make it easier to create consistency and uniform spacing._

_Some of the grid cells can be merged/ combined to give wide possibilities in the element arrangement and create unique look and composition._
